Using GNU GRUB 2 in Fedora
==========================

Though GRUB 2 provides various feature enhancements over previous GRUB
version (referred to as "GRUB", or "GRUB Legacy"), it did not reach its
stability and feature completness yet, and thus is not ready to replace
it for the whole user base. This package is primarily intended to
encourage testing and accelerate distribution integration.

It is generally safe to install the package. It is able to co-exist with
existing GRUB installation and adds itself to the GRUB menu upon
installation, so you'll able to select GRUB 2 from GRUB menu during
the boot.

Utilities
---------

The GRUB 2 utilities are prefixed (or postfixed) with 'grub2':

grub2-editenv
grub2-mkimage
grub2-mkelfimage
grub2-mkrescue
grub2-pe2elf
grub2-emu
grub2-install
grub2-mkdevicemap
grub2-probe
grub2-setup
update-grub2

Documentation
-------------

The GRUB 2 lacks documentation. While you are encouraged to contribute
the documentation, you can use the GRUB 2 Wiki [1] as primary source of
information pertaining to this development snapshot.
